### API Spec

Checkout the API Spec [here](http://microservices-demo.github.io/api/index?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/master/api-spec/catalogue.json)


### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
GO111MODULE=on go mod download
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/
GO111MODULE=on go build -o catalogue
```

The result is a binary named `catalogue`, in the current directory.

#### Docker
`docker-compose build`

### To run the service on port 8080

#### Go native

If you followed to Go build instructions, you should have a "catalogue" binary in $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/.
To run it use:
```
./catalogue
```

#### Docker
`docker-compose up`

### Run tests before submitting PRs
`make test`

### Check whether the service is alive
`curl http://localhost:8080/health`

### Use the service endpoints
`curl http://localhost:8080/catalogue`

### Push the service to Docker Container Registry
`GROUP=weaveworksdemos COMMIT=test ./scripts/push.sh`

## Test Zipkin

To test with Zipkin

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml up
```
It takes about 10 seconds to seed data

you should see it at:
[http://localhost:9411/](http://localhost:9411)
