# Catalogue
A microservices-demo service that provides catalogue/product information. 
This service is built, tested and released by travis.

## Bugs, Feature Requests and Contributing
We'd love to see community contributions. We like to keep it simple and use Github issues to track bugs and feature requests and pull requests to manage contributions.

### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -v github.com/Masterminds/glide
glide install
```

#### Go tools

$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/microservices-demo/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/
go build -o catalogue
```

The result is a binary named `catalogue`, in the current directory.

#### Docker
`docker-compose build`

### To run the service on port 8080

```

#### Docker
`docker-compose up`

### Run tests before submitting PRs
